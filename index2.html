                <h1>INSTRUCTIONS (click to destroy)</h1>
                <h2>Here's some information on how to use the app:</h2>
                <p>This app is meant to work together with the official Construct 3 tutorial from Laura_D called <a href="https://www.construct.net/en/tutorials/branching-dialogue-using-json-2395/branching-dialogue-4">Branching Dialogue Using Json:</a></p>

                <p>Please note, this is still very much an alpha version so expect bugs and things breaking! Collaborators are warmly welcomed!</p>

                <p>The basic idea is to create character dialogue trees from the big plus button at the top. When you have the first node of a dialogue tree, you can add more dialogue blocks to it from the smaller plus button in the node. You can also change the type of the node to "question" in order to add a question with branching answers.</p>

                <p>When you are done with you dialogue tree, you can export it as a JSON file from the export button at the top bar. You should be able to then take this file to Construct 3 and especially to the tutorial .c3p-file created by Laura_D. Simply import as a project file and replace the existing json file import in the eGame event sheet on even 2 (action: -> AJAX: Request dialogue.json (tag "LoadDialogue"))</p>

                <p>The characters get assigned a dialogue from the JSON based on their "SceneID" instance variable value.</p>

                <h3>Some things to note:</h3>
                <p>You can drag the dialogues around to arrange them the way you prefer. Dragging a parent dialogue will also move the children. You can also move the entire canvas by dragging from an empty area.</p>
                <p>Changing the name of the character in one dialogue tree will change it for all the nodes. If you want another character in the same JSON file export, use another dialogue tree.</p>
                <p>The "next" value tells Construct which node it should go to after the current one. We are automatically setting it to the next child node if the user has created one. If there is no child node, then the user can define where to go next by setting the value manually. </p>
                <p>The ID for each node is automatically assigned and I don't recommend changing them for now. The answer nodes need to get the same ID as the parent question has.</p>
                <p>Adding line breaks in the text are of the node will separate those into different dialogues in Construct, meaning that they will be displayed separately one-by-one. That way you can make sure large texts fit the dialogue box design of your game. </p>

                <h3>TO DO:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thinking now of rewriting the entire thing to have one giant object in memory which is controlling the drawing on the page. Now there is so much crazy traversal difficulties.. This object would also allow for easy saves and exports.</li>
                    <li>A way to import the JSON file back in order to create a node tree from it.</li>
                    <li>Deleting elements is not reliable at the moment, the ID's especially need some work</li>
                    <li>The save and delete save buttons don't work properly yet. Export to json should work though.</li>
                    <li>Proper mobile support</li>
                    <li>Mouse wheel zoom</li>
                    <li>Collapse nodes to save space</li>
                    <li>Draw a dotted line between relevant nodes when user manually sets the value of "next"</li>
                    <li>Conditions for the connecting lines, so that we can compare a condition before allowing the transition. Note that this feature needs to be programmed also for the c3p-file provided by Laura_D. I'm planning om using a dictionary for this so that I can have dynamic "variable" names.</li>
                    <li>Generic JSON exporter for other game engines</li>
                    <li>Automatic splitting of long dialogues based on character count treshold setting</li>
                    <li>Smart reordering of IDs based on user input</li>
                    <li>Automatically arrange node positions to make them look prettier in the layout</li>
                    <li>Block size slider doesn't really work yet, the plus button doesn't follow</li>
                    <li>Fix the save to localstorage feature</li>
                </ul>
