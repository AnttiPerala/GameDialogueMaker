TO DO:

Play mode for testing the dialogue interactively

The ability to load a JSON file back in for editing

LatestNode is still causing problems with other characters than character 1 when adding questions and answers

Regarding the positioning, it seems like the elements should have position absolute and it is relative to their parent node

cloning the color of the character root is still buggy

build construct implementation 

remember the selected node by stroring it in the settings object

still a bug with a previosuly connected node doesnt become an answer node when parent is changed to question

hiding children nodes

Memento pattern undo

Command pattern undo would be more efficient but harder to code
